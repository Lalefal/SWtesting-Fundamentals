> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- It was a pleasant experience. I prefer writing code as it is more interesting and challenging than writing plain text. However, writing test cases and all the needed information was challenging after all.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I viewed the module 7 instructions and read the information from the given references. Then I tried to find other example Test Cases besides the login cases, but I couldn't find any.
- I registered to GitLab to familiarize myself with the phases and navigation.
- Then, I started writing the cases, checking the instructions and examples every now and then, comparing them to what I had done and made fixes and improvements to my test cases when necessary.
- In the end I had made three different accounts to be sure my navigation information and alerts to validate were correct.
- In some parts I asked ChatGPTs opinion if there were anything to fix (ChatGPT was happy, didn't find much to correct :)
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - Not at the moment. 


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- While writing the instructions I had many troubles:
    - Who is doing the tests? How many people outside developing/testing-world knows what is More Options Icon / Ellipsis menu / Dotted Hamburger Icon? What can I assume of the testers knowledge/skills? 
    - Should all the test cases include the steps Input Username + Input Password + Submit Login Form? And if they should, should all test cases include steps for logging out?
        - I understood, that yes, all test cases should include the login steps, since the cases are not necessary executed by the same person or at the given order. Though, I didn't include the log out instructions.
    - Test Cases: Should the cases include navigation from "scratch"(from login page) or is it ok to use direct Urls? The instructions for navigation between pages are different depending where it starts.
        - I used direct URLs

- Post conditions: Sign out. Should there be an instruction for this too?
- How to specify which text are instructions and which are texts in the webpage? I had an urge to use single quotes every time I was describing text/links/buttons that are on the webpage.
- Difficulty to choose which word would be best: click, submit, choose, select. Should there be a different word for form / button / radiobutton and checkbox / link ... 
        - submit a form
        - click a button, click a link
        - select radiobutton / checkbox
        - choose from list
        - is it proper to say "press the submit-button"? Sounds wrong.
    I guess it is ok to say "submit a button", but it just feels a bit wrong. I spent quite a lot of time considering these options and then chose what I felt that were the best words to describe what should be done.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used Github many times at the following courses:
    - Fundamentals of Programming (with Python)
    - Foundations of Web Development
    - Dynamic Web Applications with JavaScript
- Didn't have any problems.   

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would use the framework or language my employer uses :)
- Robot Framework is the only one I recognize from those suggested. At CampusOnline, there has been a course about using Robot Framework and I might take that course at some point (too many interesting courses to choose from).



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- A good tester is curious, likes to solve problems, is motivated and able to learn new things and has good communication skills. Also it seems that even in the Finnish companies, proficiency in English is a requirement. 



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Since I am already 38, have been working in customer service and selling over 10 years and as a Store Manager for 4 years, Im quite contented with my softs kills (not that there isn't more to learn, always will be). So the hards kills are the thing Im developing at the moment. My goal is to be a SW/back end developer or a tester, I haven't chose yet (from which one to start).
- Obviously I need to improve my professional English.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words 
## Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? 
## (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- The biggest thing I learned was that the courses based on the learning materials of certifacates are not for me. I prefer learning by doing things, but the bigger issue is the language used in the materials: it's just some how very difficult and odd, simple things are written in a really difficult manner and made hard to understand. This course wasn't as bad as Data Networks and Information Security: The Cisco book was nothing but obfuscation. So Im really looking forward to the Functional Testing of Software-course. Hopefully that is more about doing than reading.
- So yes, the project helped putting theoretical knowledge into practice. Otherwise I just have plenty of sentences in my head and Im not quite sure what to do with all of that data. For me it would have been more effective to first gain some base about testing by doing it (projects or few years of working) before studying the theoretics so widely. But at least know Im able to say that 'yes, I have heard or read about it' at job interview etc. situations.
- To be clear: Im not judging the course itself, just saying that for me it wasn't the best way to learn :)
